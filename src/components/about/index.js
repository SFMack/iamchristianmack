      <p>
        I first began coding in high school where I got my feet wet with HTML
        and CSS. This past year I have gained experience working with teams to
        build full-stack projects utilizing React JS, Node JS, Express, and
        more. After learning so much, I have the opportunity to give back to the
        community that helped me and now I help students, as a Team Lead, to
        learn and grow as developers.
